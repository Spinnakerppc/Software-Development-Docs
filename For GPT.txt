-the fetch sensor and imu buttons are not working.
-the web page is not populating the sensor or imu tables.
-please remove the 'logarithm' approach, and work with raw data.




-Temperature is not showing correct value, pressure is also wrong.

Please Add:

Custom time config for the top-of-hour logic

Trend detection thresholds or alerts

Dashboard redesign or auto-refresh

Do NOT remove anything unless it is a correctoin....




Great!

-The website displays the graphs, but not tables of data - I think 20 readings will be appropriate.
-The sensor data is not being sampled as often as the IMU?
-The sampling on the hour (adjustable) was removed - please put it back.
-we are missing some of the troubleshooting prints - put them back please.
-The temperature and pressure values are way high - is this a software problem?
